            <h3> Theory of Statistical Learning </h3>
            <p> Statistical Learning (including Machine learning) aims to explore the underlying features of datasets and make sound predictions. 
              I am interested in the statistical properties of the estimators arisen from machine learning algorithms (e.g. PCA). 
              Thanks to recent advances in random matrix theory, we may prove quantitative estimates of distributions of estimators 
              (e.g. oracle inequalities), and hence evaluate their reliability.</p>

            <h3> Bayesian Computation </h3>
            <p> The classical Bayes formula had motivated another Bayesian Statistics, which explores how our beliefs interact with data. 
              This is particularly useful in modeling time evolutions, e.g. the spread of Covid-19. Nevertheless, posterior distributions 
              are usually hard to be analytically computed, so we simulate them instead (e.g. generate histograms/obtain summary statistics). 
              There are two classical algorithms for the simulation of distributions, namely Rejection Sampling and Metropolitan Hastings. 
              Recent studies suggest that ideas of physics can be used to simulate distributions efficiently. I would like to look at how 
              these algorithms behind in complex models (with complex state spaces).</p>

            <h3> Dynamical Systems and Stochastic Analysis </h3>
            <p> I have always been astonished by the relationship between deterministic differential equations and Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE). 
            The classical formulae of Dynkin and Feynman-Kac had helped us to study the quantitative behaviors of solutions to differential equations. 
            Recent studies revealed that chaotic systems like the Lorenz system behave like random walks. This motivates me to study how one can construct 
            dynamical systems that have similar behavior as solutions of SDE, and how could we exploit this relation in proving estimates for dynamical systems. 
            I am also drawn to understanding the behavior of return maps of chaotic systems.
