              I mainly work in two areas of mathematics:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li> <b> Theory of Statistics: </b> Develop fast algorithms for bayesian computations (e.g.
              Monte-Carlo); study statistical properties of estimators arisen from machine learning algorithms
              (e.g. components in PCA); applying statistical techniques to analyse and interpret real-life data. 
              </li>
              <li> <b> Dynamical System: </b> Utilise the connection between dynamical systems (e.g.
              Lorenz system) and stochastic processes to establish quantitative results. I am also
              drawn to the study of return maps of chaotic systems.
              </li> 
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div className="home-flexright">
            <Image src={randomWalk} 
            des="A trajectory simulated by a chaotic process, which
            resembles random walk." />

            In addition to my research, I am creating resources to enhance undergraduates' experiences
            in learning computational mathematics and statistics. These include a book on multivariate analysis with
            demonstration in Julia language, and a repository of numerical methods. I am also a peer
            tutor at Imperial College helping current freshmen (first-year undergraudates) to adopt
            university life in a rapidly-changing Covid-19 situation.

            My personal journey in mathematics began when I entered the HKCCCU Logos Academy (a comprehensive
            school in Hong Kong). I had participated various enrichment programs offered by the Hong Kong University
            of Science and Technology (HKUST) from Grade 8 to Grade 11. I then completed GCE A-Level and joined Imperial 
            College London at the age of 16.

            In addition, I enjoy performing music (mainly by playing piano), building Minecraft architectures, 
            exploring Christianity and developing webpages.
