# Samuel's Personal Site

Welcome to the github page of my personal site where most of the source codes for my website has been stored. The source codes follow a MIT License, which means there is almost no restriction for reproduction/distribution of the source code (see License.md for details).

Acknowledgement to weblab staff at MIT which has provided skeleton codes and makes life easier. Their webpage can be found <a href="https://weblab.mit.edu/"> here. </a> Please note that not all features have been implemented (I probably don't need sockets for now. Neither do login feature (Idk...), don't want to mess up with GDPR requirement...)
